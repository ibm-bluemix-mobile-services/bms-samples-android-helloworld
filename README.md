# Android hellobluemix application for Bluemix Mobile Services
---
This hellobluemix sample contains an Android project that you can use to learn more about Bluemix Mobile Services.

Use the following steps to configure the hellobluemix sample for Android:

1. [Download the hellobluemix sample](#download-the-hellobluemix-sample)
2. [Configure the mobile backend for your hellobluemix application](#configure-the-mobile-backend-for-your-hellobluemix-application)
3. [Configure the front end in the hellobluemix sample](#configure-the-front-end-in-the-hellobluemix-sample)
4. [Run the Android app](#run-the-android-app)

### Before you begin
Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- A [Bluemix](http://bluemix.net) account.

### Download the hellobluemix sample
Clone the sample from IBM DevOps Services with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/bms-samples-android-hellobluemix
```

If you have not done so already, at this time please acquire and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

### Configure the mobile backend for your hellobluemix application
Before you can run the hellobluemix application, you must set up an app on Bluemix.  The following procedure shows you how to create a MobileFirst Services Starter application. A Node.js runtime environment is created so that you can provide server-side functions, such as resource URIs and static files. The CloudantÂ®NoSQL DB, IBM Push Notifications, and Mobile Client Access services are then added to the app.

Create a mobile backend in the  Bluemix dashboard:

1.	In the **Boilerplates** section of the Bluemix catalog, click **MobileFirst Services Starter**.
2.	Enter a name and host for your mobile backend and click **Create**.
3.	Click **Finish**.

### Configure the front end in the hellobluemix sample
1. Using Android Studio, open the `bms-samples-android-hellobluemix` directory where the project was cloned.
2. Run a Gradle sync (usually starts automatically) to import the required `core` SDK. You can view the **build.gradle** file in the following directory:

	`app\build.gradle`

3. Once that is complete, open `MainActivity.java` and locate the try block within the ```onCreate()``` function.
4. In the ```BMSClient.getInstance().initialize()``` function replace ```<APPLICATION_ROUTE>``` and ```<APPLICATION_ID>``` with the application route and ID you were given when creating your application on Bluemix. Update the region parameter if not using REGION_US_SOUTH (REGION_UK or REGION_SYDNEY).
```java
		try {
            //initialize SDK with IBM Bluemix application ID and route
            //TODO: Please replace <APPLICATION_ROUTE> with a valid ApplicationRoute and <APPLICATION_ID> with a valid ApplicationId
            BMSClient.getInstance().initialize(this, "<APPLICATION_ROUTE>", "<APPLICATION_ID>", BMSClient.REGION_US_SOUTH);
        }
```

> **Note**: If your Bluemix app is **not** hosted in US_SOUTH, be sure to update the region parameter appropriately: BMSClient.REGION_SYDNEY or BMSClient.REGION_UK.

### Run the Android App
Now you can run your Android Application in your mobile emulator or on your device.

You will see a single view application with a "PING BLUEMIX" button. When you click this button the application will test the connection from the client to the backend Bluemix application. The application uses the ApplicationRoute specified in the AppDelegate in order to test the connection. The application will then display if the connection was successful or unsuccessful. In the unsuccessful state an error will be displayed in the log as well as in the application.

>**Note**: Inside the **Main Activity** a Get request is made to the Node.js runtime on Bluemix. This code has been provided in the MobileFirst Services Starter boilerplate. If the backend application was not created using the MobileFirst Services Starter boilerplate the application will not be able to connect successfully.
